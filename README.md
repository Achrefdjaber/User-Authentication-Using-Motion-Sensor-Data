## 📂 Dataset

The **HMOG dataset** provides rich motion and gesture data collected via mobile device sensors, including:
- **📡 Motion Data**: Accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings.
- **👆 Touch Gesture Data**: Logs of user interaction with the touchscreen (e.g., swipe gestures).

### Key Details:
- **Data Composition**: Includes recordings from multiple users across different sessions.
- **Subset Selection**: For this project, data from **3 users with 13 sessions each** was used.
- **Preprocessing**: Data standardization, balancing, and slicing were implemented to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.
